                    <strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
                    North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
                    years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
                    that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
                    with our modern mobile food truck.
